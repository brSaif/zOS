# Intro

                                PHREAK
                    Look, you wanna be elite? You gotta do a
                    righteous hack. None of this accidental shit.

                                CEREAL
                    Oh yeah, you want a seriously righteous hack,
                    you score one of those Gibsons man. You know,
                    supercomputers they use to like, do physics,
                    and look for oil and stuff?

                                PHREAK
                    Ain't no way, man, security's too tight. The
                    big iron?

                                DADE
                    Maybe. But, if I were gonna hack some heavy
                    metal, I'd, uh, work my way back through some
                    low security, and try the back door.

## Motivation
```
Despite of anakata's motives one thing is certain, thanks to him some
people got hooked and started to talk about the security of mainframes.
Since then, few individuals, and before that even fewer, did their best
sharing their knowledge in the field and contributing to the infosec and
mainframe communities. This however was still not enough to close the gap
between mainframes and the rest of the world.

There's a possibility that at some point it will become a go to place for
everyone who would like to have fun and learn about mainframe security,
exactly the same way OWASP became such place for web apps. Or not.
