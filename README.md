                                PHREAK
                    Look, you wanna be elite? You gotta do a
                    righteous hack. None of this accidental shit.

                                CEREAL
                    Oh yeah, you want a seriously righteous hack,
                    you score one of those Gibsons man. You know,
                    supercomputers they use to like, do physics,
                    and look for oil and stuff?

                                PHREAK
                    Ain't no way, man, security's too tight. The
                    big iron?

                                DADE
                    Maybe. But, if I were gonna hack some heavy
                    metal, I'd, uh, work my way back through some
                    low security, and try the back door.

## Motivation
```
Regardless of anakata's intentions one thing is certain, thanks to him
some people got hooked and started to talk about the security of
mainframes.  Since then, few individuals, and before that even fewer,
did their best sharing their knowledge in the field and contributing to
the infosec and mainframe communities. This however was still not enough
to close the gap between mainframes and the rest of the world.

I'm kicking-off a libre project by sharing the bits and pieces gathered
over the years on the subject.  I want to encourage you to contribute so
we can build together a go to place for everyone who would like to have
fun and learn about mainframe security.
